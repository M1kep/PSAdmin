## What is PSAdmin
PSAdmin is a PowerShell Designed toolkit for System Administrators to Easily Deploy and manage their Computer Systems.

## What it is now
Currently PSAdmin is a Database tool designed to handle your assets as cleanly and dynamically as possible.

### It's Experimental!
By far this is no where a complete project as it should evolve since the ambition for the project clearly outweighs what a single person's ambition can do on his spare time after work.

## PSAdmin Core Components

Note this is always changing and will change as features get added.
