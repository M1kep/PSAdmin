## What is PSAdmin
PSAdmin is a PowerShell Designed toolkit for System Administrators to Easily Deploy and manage their Computer Systems.

## What it is now
Currently PSAdmin is a Database tool designed to handle your assets as cleanly and dynamically as possible.

### It's Experimental!
By far this is no where a complete project as it should evolve since the ambition for the project clearly outweighs what a single person's ambition can do on his spare time after work.

## Examples of use
```sh
Import-Module $PWD\Source\PSAdmin.psm1
Open-PSAdmin -Path "$pwd\MyDatabase\MyDatabase.xml"
New-PSAdminMachine -Name "MyName" -Description "MyDescription" -IP "YourIP"
Set-PSAdminMachine -Name "MyName" -Location "MyLocation"
Get-PSAdminMachine -Name "MyName"
Remove-PSAdminMachine -Name "Myname"
```
