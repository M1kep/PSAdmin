## What is a KeyVault?

A Keyvault is a safe and secure way to store your Secret data at rest.

## How does it work?

A Keyvault will create a VaultKey (a Randomly Generated Value) that will be used to Secure your data.

This Key is stored plainly inside the database for safekeeping. This can be encrypted further by a certificate from the Certificate Store to actually make the data secure.

NOTE:
Certificates are not stored Encrypted.
KeyVaultSecrets are stored Encrypted.

Ok so it really wasnt that technical.
